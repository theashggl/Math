1) The page that opens after floating action button, needs padding from all sides and the numerical input needs to be made smaller.
@todo
2) The buttons need a better ui on the home page
3) The replay icon needs refurbishing so as to look like a replay button, not refresh button.
4) Separate screen should be there solely for generating the numbers.
5) Numbers display screen will automatically close after displaying the numbers. A back button will appear after some time if not closed.
